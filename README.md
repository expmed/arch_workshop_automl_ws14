# ARCH Workshop: Simplifying Machine Learning Model Development with AutoML [WS14]

## Hands On Module

In this workshop, we will be working exclusively from within a Google Colab notebook and instance.
After opening the Colab notebook via the link below, please switch the runtime type to `T4 GPU` by clicking the "Additional connection options" dropdown button to the right of the "Connect" button in the top-right corner and choosing `Change runtime type -> T4 GPU` prior to running the cells in this hands on module. This runtime type will ensure that we have a GPU enabled instance to run the training of the `MultiModalPredictor` class in section 6 of the notebook more efficiently.
